- Add bag meta data alongside bag data.
 ## Potentially 'Bag.HasMeta()', 'BagMeta.Get()', 'BagMeta.Set()'.
 # Containing the bag's information, including creator and more.
 # This can also help reduce NBT tags on the bag item, so that only bag-uuid is needed.

- Add command to open bags, and to rename bag's "identifier" (i.e. 'bag1' 'coolbag').
 # Requires BagMeta stated above, to read and store this info.
 # In addition, create a map file of uuids -> identifiers and reverse.

- Add an inactivity removal option, to remove inactive bags.
 # Create time-table of all bags, resetting when bag or inventory is opened. (Have a config-version upgrade to add existing bags on servers already using HB)
 # Add config variables such as enabled, inactivity time, lang entry, and so forth.

- Remove the ability to clone bags in creative using Middle-mouse.
 # Inventory events not triggering when inside the creative inventory..

- Upgrade Lang to fully support PAPI.

- Make "player" a requirement for all lang parses.

- Upgrade Lang to use it's own placeholders like DiscordChatMonitor.
